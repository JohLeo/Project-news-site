# News Site

The brief was to creat a news site containing a header, main news article and a grid of news articles. 
The layout should be responsive with different layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop. 
Main goal was to use (and learn) flexbox and grid.

## The problem

I went through the pre-course material to begin with and then creatad an idea and design of how I wanted it look in indesign. After that I used the basics from the pre-course material and started coding. Realised pretty quick that I needed the internet for more tutorials and information, google is my best friend now. 
I did the basic overal look first and then took it step by step to create the look I wanted very slowly with a lot of serching for answers. It is not really what I envisioned since I did not have time enough to figure som things out. HOW do you get a google-font to work in Safari, and why does some details of the layout not work in safari as it does in Chrome or Firefox etc etc? Buut I had a lot of fun doing this and learned a lot!
If I had more time I would try to learn even more to understand it all better, and figure out how to make details from my first sketch to work.
